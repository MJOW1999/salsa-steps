## Beginners 1

### Right Turn

Steps

1. Step forward with your left foot at a 2 o'clock direction.
2. Turn your right foot so it is facing 180 degrees from its initial position. 
3. Use your right leg to pivot back to your original spot. 

### Left Turn

Steps

1. Step forward with your left foot (like in the Basic Steps)
2. Step in the same spot with your right foot (I like to angle my foot inwards here)
3. Turn and place your left foot behind you, so it is facing 180 degrees from its initial position.

5. Now that you are facing the opposite direction, place your right foot forward
6. Turn your left foot so it is facing your original direction and back to its original spot
7. Turn your right foot in a similar way to the left, so it is back in its original spot
