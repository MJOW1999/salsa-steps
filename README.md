## Inspiration

I've recently been learning Cuban Salsa as part of a class. Each week we learn various steps, so I wanted an easy way to remember them!

## Process

- Started by going through the weeks and pinpointing which steps were required. (_06/03_)
- Adding Basic Steps and details of it to begin with. (_07/03_)

In Progress ...

## Features

- In Progress

To-do list:

- Create redux slices for all of the current steps and an additional one for turns
- Design the webpage
- Maybe add Storybook documentation of the components
- Test accessibility of the webpage
- In short, a lot :sweat_smile:

## Status

Project is: _in progress_
